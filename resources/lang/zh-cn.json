It is important to keep the secret key secure and not share it with others to prevent unauthorized use of the CAPTCHA.":"Recaptcha是由Google开发的一种安全措施，它结合了机器学习和高级风险分析算法将人类与机器人区分开。它旨在通过要求用户证明自己不是机器人来保护网站免受垃圾邮件和滥用。可以使用简单的API在网页上实现recaptcha，该API向用户显示挑战，例如识别图像中的对象或求解数学问题，以验证其身份。 Recaptcha用于防止垃圾邮件，欺诈和其他恶意活动。重要的是要确保秘密钥匙安全，并且不要与其他人共享，以防止未经授权使用验证码。","Recent Posts":"最近的帖子","Recently Added":"最近添加的","Recently Added In":"最近添加了","Recently AddedIn":"最近","Recently Blog":"最近博客","recently blog":"最近博客","Recently Registered Users":"最近注册的用户","Recommended Image Size : 300x90.
